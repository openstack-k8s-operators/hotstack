# Hotloop - Pipeline Structured Language Documentation

This document explains the structured language used to define the Hotloop
pipeline. The pipeline is organized into a series of **stages**, each
representing a distinct phase in the deployment or configuration process.

## Stages

A **stage** is a logical unit within the CI pipeline that performs a specific
set of actions. Each stage has a `name` for identification and can optionally
include a `documentation` field to provide a human-readable description of its
purpose. Stages are executed sequentially in the order they are defined in the
YAML document.

By organizing the pipeline into these stages and utilizing the different stage
types, the CI process becomes modular, readable, and maintainable. Each stage
focuses on a specific task, making it easier to understand the overall
workflow and to troubleshoot any potential issues.

Here's a breakdown of the common attributes within a stage:

* **`name`**: (Required) A unique identifier for the stage.
  This name is typically used for logging and monitoring purposes.
* **`documentation`**: (Optional) A multi-line string providing a detailed
  explanation of what the stage does, its context, and any important
  considerations. This is helpful for understanding the pipeline's flow and
  the purpose of each step.
* **`manifest`**: (Optional) Specifies the path to a YAML manifest file that
  will be applied to the target environment (e.g., an OpenShift cluster using
  `oc apply -f`). This is commonly used for deploying Kubernetes or OpenShift
  resources.
* **`j2_manifest`**: (Optional) Specifies the path to a Jinja2 template file
  that will be rendered into a YAML manifest and then applied to the target
  environment. This is useful for creating dynamic configurations based on
  variables.
* **`patches`** (Optional): A list of YAML patches to apply to `manifests` and/or `j2_manifests`.
  * Each patch must define:
    * `path`: The location in the YAML data for replacement.
    * `value`: The new value to replace the existing one.
  * A patch can optionally include a list of `where` conditions.
    * Each `where` condition requires:
      * `path`: The specific location within the YAML data to evaluate.
      * `value`: The value to compare against at the specified path.
  * Jinja2 manifests are templated first, then patches are applied.
  * The `value` replaces the current value, no merge.
  * Patches apply to all YAML documents in the file with the specified path.
  * An error is raised if no YAML document in the file has the specified path.

  **Example patch:**

    ```yaml
    - path: "spec.dns.template.options.[0].values"
      value:
        - 192.168.32.250
        - 192.168.32.251
      where:
        - path: kind
          value: OpenStackControlPlane
        - path: metadata.namespace
          value: openstack-b
    ```

* **`cmd`**: (Optional) Defines a single command-line instruction to be
  executed on the pipeline runner. This is suitable for simple tasks like
  labeling nodes or triggering external scripts.
* **`script`**: (Optional) Defines a script that will be executed on the
  pipeline runner. This is useful for more complex logic or sequences of
  commands.
* **`wait_conditions`**: (Optional) A list of commands that are executed to
  wait for a specific condition to be met in the target environment. These
  are typically `oc wait` commands in the context of OpenShift, ensuring that
  resources are created, become ready, or reach a desired state before the
  pipeline proceeds. Each item in the list is a command-line string.

## Stage Types

The pipeline utilizes different stage types to perform various actions. Here's
a detailed explanation of each type:

### 1. `cmd` Stage

The `cmd` stage type executes a single command-line instruction. It's
straightforward and suitable for simple, direct actions on the system where
the pipeline is running or against a configured target environment (like an
OpenShift cluster via `oc`).

**Example:**

```yaml
- name: Node label vrf
  cmd: oc label node master-0 vrf=true
```

In this example, the cmd stage executes the oc label node master-0 vrf=true
command to label a node named master-0 with the key vrf and value true.

### 2. `script` Stage

The `script` stage type executes a script. This allows for more complex logic
and a sequence of commands to be performed within a single stage. The script
attribute would specify a multiline string.

**Example:**

```yaml
- name: Set a multiattach volume type and create it if needed
  script: |
    set -xe -o pipefail
    oc project openstack

    oc rsh openstackclient \
      openstack volume type show multiattach &>/dev/null || \
        oc rsh openstackclient openstack volume type create multiattach

    oc rsh openstackclient \
      openstack volume type set --property multiattach="<is> True" multiattach
```

### 3. `manifest` Stage

The `manifest` stage type applies a YAML manifest file to the target
environment. This is the primary way to deploy and configure Kubernetes or
OpenShift resources defined in static YAML files. The manifest attribute
specifies the path to the YAML file.

In addition to applying the manifest, the `patches` attribute allows you to
modify the YAML data before deployment. Patches are replacing the current
values at the specified paths without merging. This enables you to update and
customize the manifest content dynamically.

**Example:**

```yaml
- name: Openstack Controlplane
  manifest: "openstack_controlplane.yaml"
  patches:
    - path: "spec.dns.template.options.[0].values"
        value:
          - 192.168.32.250
          - 192.168.32.251
  wait_conditions:
    - >-
      oc wait -n metallb-system pod -l component=speaker --for condition=Ready
      --timeout=300s"
```

Here, the `manifest` stage applies the YAML file located at
`openstack_controlplane.yaml`. The `wait_conditions` then ensure that the
MetalLB speaker pods become ready before the pipeline moves to the next stage.

### 4. `j2_manifest` Stage

The `j2_manifest` stage type renders a Jinja2 template file into a YAML
manifest and then applies the resulting YAML to the target environment. This
is powerful for creating dynamic configurations where values are injected into
the YAML based on variables or context. The `j2_manifest` attribute specifies
the path to the Jinja2 template file.

In addition to applying the manifest, the `patches` attribute allows you to
modify the YAML data before deployment. Patches are applied after Jinja2
templating, replacing the current values at the specified paths without
merging. This enables you to update and customize the manifest content
dynamically.

**Example:**

```yaml
- name: Common OLM
  j2_manifest: "{{ common_dir }}/olm.yaml.j2"
  patches:
    - where:
        - path: kind
          value: Subscription
        - path: metadata.name
          value: openstack-operator
        - path: metadata.namespace
          value: openstack-operators
      path: "spec.channel"
      value: "stable-v1.0"
  wait_conditions:
    - >-
      oc wait namespaces cert-manager-operator --for jsonpath='{.status.phase}=Active'
      --timeout=300s
    # ... other wait conditions ...
```

In this example, the `olm.yaml.j2` Jinja2 template is rendered, and the
resulting YAML is applied. The `wait_conditions` then verify the successful
creation and readiness of the involved kubernetes resources like namespaces,
operator groups, catalog sources, subscriptions etc.
