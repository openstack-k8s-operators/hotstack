      Creates a Cinder volume type with multiattach capability enabled, allowing volumes
      to be simultaneously attached to multiple instances. This is essential for shared
      storage scenarios like clustered databases or file systems in the test environment.

    documentation: >-
      Establishes the external network that provides IP connectivity to instances.
      This network is mapped to the physical 'datacentre' network and serves as the gateway

  - name: Create private network if needed
    documentation: >-
      Creates the default tenant network for instance-to-instance communication.
      This shared network allows multiple tenants to deploy instances that can
      communicate privately while being isolated from external networks until
      floating IPs are assigned.

  - name: Create network for ironic provisioning if needed
    documentation: >-
      Establishes the dedicated baremetal provisioning network mapped to the physical
      'ironic' network interface. This isolated network carries PXE boot traffic, DHCP
      for baremetal nodes, and communication between Ironic services and nodes during
      deployment operations, keeping provisioning traffic separate from tenant networks.

  - name: Create baremetal flavor if needed
    documentation: >-
      Defines Nova flavor for baremetal instances with custom resource requirements.
      Uses CUSTOM_BAREMETAL=1 to match against baremetal node resource classes,
      while setting standard resources (VCPU, MEMORY_MB, DISK_GB) to 0 since
      physical resources are managed by Ironic rather than Nova's scheduler.

    documentation: >-
      Transfers the baremetal node definition file containing BMC credentials,

    documentation: >-
      Registers physical baremetal nodes with the Ironic service using the node
      definitions from ironic_nodes.yaml. This creates Ironic node records with
      BMC access credentials, hardware profiles, and port configurations, marking
      the beginning of the node lifecycle management in OpenStack.

      Monitors node state transition to 'enroll' status, indicating that Ironic
      has successfully registered the nodes and validated basic BMC connectivity.
      This is the first state in the baremetal provisioning lifecycle, confirming
      that nodes are recognized by the system before management operations begin.

  - name: Manage ironic nodes
    documentation: >-
      Initiates the transition from 'enroll' to 'manageable' state by instructing
      Ironic to perform hardware introspection and validation. During this process,
      Ironic will power on nodes, inspect hardware capabilities, and prepare them
      for provisioning operations while validating BMC access and power management.

  - name: Wait for ironic nodes to get to state - manageable
    documentation: >-
      Waits for nodes to complete hardware introspection and reach 'manageable' state.
      In this state, Ironic has successfully inventoried hardware resources, validated
      BMC functionality, and confirmed the nodes are ready for cleaning and provisioning
      operations. This is a prerequisite for making nodes available to tenants.

      Ensures all baremetal nodes are powered down before configuration changes.

    documentation: >-
      Verifies that power management commands have taken effect and all nodes
      report 'power off' status. This confirmation is critical before transitioning

    documentation: >-
      Transitions nodes from 'manageable' to 'available' state, making them eligible
