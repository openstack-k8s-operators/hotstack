## Tempest Tests Configuration for Test Operator

The YAML file, `tempest-tests.yml`, is a configuration for running Tempest
tests, which is a validation framework for OpenStack. Here's a breakdown of the
configuration:

1. **apiVersion, kind, and metadata**: These fields define the API version,
   kind (type) of resource, and metadata (name and namespace) for the Tempest
   test job.

2. **spec**: This section contains the configuration for the Tempest test job.

   - **networkAttachments**: This field specifies the network attachment for
     the test job. In this case, it's set to `ctlplane`.
   - **storageClass**: This field sets the storage class for the test job to
     `lvms-local-storage`.
   - **privileged**: This field is set to `true`, which means the test
     containers will have elevated privileges.
   - **workflow**: This section defines the steps to be executed in the test
     job. There are two steps in this configuration:
     - **ironic-scenario-testing**: This step runs scenario tests for Ironic,
       the OpenStack bare-metal provisioning service. The `tempestconfRun`
       section configures Tempest settings for this step, such as disabling
       isolated networks, setting the number of available nodes, and specifying
       the compute flavor and hypervisor type. The `tempestRun` section
       specifies the concurrency level and the list of tests to include and
       exclude.
     - **ironic-api-testing**: This step runs API tests for Ironic. Similar to
       the previous step, the `tempestconfRun` section configures Tempest
       settings, and the `tempestRun` section specifies the concurrency level
       and the list of tests to include and exclude.

In summary, this YAML file configures a Tempest test job to run two types of
tests for Ironic: scenario tests and API tests. The tests are executed with
specific configurations and concurrency levels.
