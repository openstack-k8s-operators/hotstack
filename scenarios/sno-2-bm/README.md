## Heat Orchestration Template (HOT)

The `heat_template.yaml` template is used to deploy and manage infrastructure
resources in OpenStack. The template sets up a 4-node infrastructure consisting
of a Controller node, an OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) Master node, and
two Ironic nodes.

## Hotstack Hotloop Automation Pipeline

The YAML `automation-vars.yml` defines a Hotstack hotloop automation pipeline,
which automates the deployment and configuration of an OpenStack environment on
an OpenShift cluster. The pipeline consists of several stages, each
representing a specific task or set of tasks in the deployment process.

### Stages

1. **TopoLVM Common**
   - **Documentation**: Installs the TopoLVM Container Storage Interface (CSI)
     driver on the OCP cluster using LVMS (Logical Volume Manager Storage) for
     dynamic provisioning of local storage.
   - **Manifest**: Refers to the `topolvm.yaml` file for the deployment
     manifest.
   - **Wait conditions**: Checks the status of namespaces, operator groups,
     and ClusterServiceVersion resources.
2. **TopoLVM LVMCluster**
   - **Documentation**: Creates a TopoLVM - LVMCluster on the OpenShift
     cluster, configuring the LVMCluster custom resource (CR) to create LVM
     volume groups and configure a list of devices for the volume groups.
   - **Manifest**: Refers to the `topolvmcluster.yaml` file for the deployment
     manifest.
   - **Wait conditions**: Checks the status of the LVMCluster CR.
3. **Node Label cinder-lvm**
   - **Documentation**: Applies the `openstack.org/cinder-lvm=` label to a
     specific node, ensuring that only one node has this label for the Cinder
     LVM backend.
   - **Command**: Uses `oc label` to apply the label to the specified node.
4. **Common OLM**
   - **Documentation**: Installs OpenStack K8S operators and their dependencies
     using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).
   - **J2 Manifest**: Refers to the `olm.yaml.j2` file for the deployment
     manifest, which uses Jinja2 templating.
   - **Wait conditions**: Checks the status of various namespaces,
     OperatorGroup, and Subscription CRs, as well as the readiness of specific
     pods.
5. **Common MetalLB**
   - **Manifest**: Refers to the `metallb.yaml` file for the deployment
     manifest, which configures MetalLB for load balancing.
   - **Wait conditions**: Checks the status of MetalLB speaker pods.
6. **Common NMState**
   - **Manifest**: Refers to the `nmstate.yaml` file for the deployment
     manifest, which configures NetworkManager for network policies.
   - **Wait conditions**: Checks the status of NMState operator and webhook
     deployments.
7. **Openstack**
   - **Manifest**: Refers to the `openstack.yaml` file for the deployment
     manifest, which configures the OpenStack operators and services.
   - **Wait conditions**: Checks the status of OpenStack operator, deployment,
     and service resources.
8. **NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy (nncp)**
   - **Manifest**: Refers to the `nncp.yaml` file for the deployment manifest,
     which configures NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy resources for network
     policies.
   - **Wait conditions**: Checks the status of nncp resources.
9. **NetworkAttchmentDefinition (NAD)**
   - **Manifest**: Refers to the `nad.yaml` file for the deployment manifest,
     which configures NetworkAttachmentDefinitions for network policies.
10. **MetalLB - L2Advertisement and IPAddressPool**
    - **Manifest**: Refers to the `metallb.yaml` file for the deployment
      manifest, which configures MetalLB for L2 advertisement and IP address
      pools.
11. **Netconfig**
    - **Manifest**: Refers to the `netconfig.yaml` file for the deployment
      manifest, which configures network settings.
12. **OpenstackControlPlane**
    - **Manifest**: Refers to the `control-plane.yaml` file for the deployment
      manifest, which configures the OpenStack control plane.
    - **Wait conditions**: Checks the status of the OpenStack control plane
      resource.

In summary, this YAML snippet defines a Hotstack hotloop automation pipeline,
which automates the deployment and configuration of an OpenStack environment on
an OpenShift cluster. Each stage represents a specific task or set of tasks in
the deployment process, with documentation, manifest references, and wait
conditions provided for each stage.
