# Makefile

The documentation generated by this Makefile is intended to provide detailed
instructions and guidance for manually reproducing a specific  `hotstack`
scenario. The Makefile sets up a virtual environment, installs required
packages, builds the documentation.

By following the documentation, users can manually set up the scenario without
relying on automated tools or scripts, allowing them to gain a deeper
understanding of the underlying processes and configurations. This is
particularly useful for learning, debugging, or customizing the scenario to
fit specific requirements.

## Variables

- `SPHINX_BUILD`: The command to build Sphinx documentation.
- `BUILD_DIR`: The directory where the built documentation will be stored.
- `SOURCE_DIR`: The directory containing the source documentation files.
- `SCENARIO`: The name of the specific scenario for which the documentation is
  being built.
- `SCENARIOS_DIR`: The directory containing the scenario-specific files.
- `VENV_DIR`: The directory where the virtual environment for the documentation
  build will be created.

## Targets

- `scenario_doc`: Builds the documentation for the specified scenario and
  creates a gzipped tarball.
  - `scenario_doc_venv`: Creates a virtual environment, activates it, and
    installs the required packages.
  - `clean`: Removes the built documentation and the tarball.
  - `clean_venv`: Removes the virtual environment.
- `clean_all`: Combines `clean` and `clean_venv` to remove all generated files
  and the virtual environment.

## Usage

To build the documentation for a specific scenario, set the `SCENARIO` and
`SCENARIOS_DIR` variables and run:

```shell
make scenario_doc SCENARIO=<scenario_name> SCENARIOS_DIR=<path_to_the_scenarios_directory>
```

This will build documentation, the results will be in the `build` directory.

## Error Handling

If `SCENARIO` or `SCENARIOS_DIR` are not set, the Makefile will display an
error message and stop execution.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have `make` and `python3` installed on your system.
