    Install the OpenStack K8S operators (Namespaces, OperatorGroup, and Subscription CRs.)

    Once these CRs are created, run the `oc wait` commands to confirm that
    each step of this procedure is complete.

- name: Patch openstack-operators leader election tuneables
  documentation: |
    Apply performance tuning patches to OpenStack operator leader election settings.

    This stage runs the hotstack-leader-election-tune command to optimize leader
    election behavior for better stability. The tuning is conditionally applied based
    on the OpenStack operators version, skipping versions v1.0.0-v1.0.11 where different
    tuning parameters are needed.
