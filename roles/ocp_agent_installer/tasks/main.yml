# stability for 5 seconds, uncordon the nodes then wait for cluster stability,
# wait for route.openshift.io API version to be available.

# The wait for cluster stability is repeated with a short stable state
# requirement. This is faster than waiting one time for a longer time because
# the timer is reset every time cluster stability is lost.
#
# Even if the cluster is stable, the route.openshift.io API version may not be
# available, wait for it to appear in oc api-versions output.
